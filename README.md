## How to Play 
- You start with a character who is given certain attributes: *Move*, *Attack*, and *HP*. 
  - The *Move* attribute determines how many squares that you can move each turn. 
  - The *Attack* attribute determines how much damage you deal to enemies when you attack them. 
  - The *HP* attribute represents how much health your character has left. If your HP reaches zero, your character dies. 
- Navigate your character to the top of the grid and let one turn pass in order to move on! No enemy can be on the top grid with you in order for you to move on. Either defeat the enemy or sneak past them.
- Use your character's *Action/Item Cards* in battle! Your character needs food for manna in order to perform actions, so make sure to collect food.
- When you are finished with your turn, click *The Horn* to indicate the end of your turn.
